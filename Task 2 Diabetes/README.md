# MeriSkill - Diabetes Patient Data Analysis



## Introduction

Effective management and understanding of diabetes require comprehensive data analysis to identify patterns, correlations, and insights that can guide medical decisions and patient care strategies. This project leverages the power of Python and its robust libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn, to perform an in-depth analysis of diabetes patient data. By examining key health indicators, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights to improve patient outcomes and enhance the overall understanding of diabetes trends and risk factors.



## Description

This diabetes patient data analysis project aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making in medical practice by providing a detailed examination of various health metrics. The analysis includes key attributes such as patient demographics, blood glucose levels, BMI, age, and other relevant medical metrics. The objective is to extract actionable insights and trends that can inform medical interventions, lifestyle recommendations, and healthcare policies.

Patient Demographics: Analysis of age, gender, and other demographic factors.

Blood Glucose Levels: Examination of fasting blood glucose levels and HbA1c readings.

BMI and Health Metrics: Analysis of Body Mass Index (BMI) and its correlation with diabetes risk factors.

Correlation Analysis: Identifying correlations between different health metrics and diabetes.

Trend Analysis: Examining trends and patterns in the data over time.


By leveraging Python and its analytical libraries, this project transforms raw patient data into meaningful insights, facilitating improved patient care and strategic healthcare planning.



## About the Dataset

The dataset consists of diabetes patient data collected over a specified period. It includes various attributes essential for comprehensive diabetes analysis:

• PatientID: Unique identifier for each patient.
• Age: Age of the patient.
• Gender: Gender of the patient.
• FastingBloodGlucose: Fasting blood glucose levels of the patient.
• HbA1c: Glycated hemoglobin levels indicating long-term blood glucose control.
• BMI: Body Mass Index of the patient.
• BloodPressure: Blood pressure readings.
• InsulinLevel: Insulin levels of the patient.
• DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.



## Business Task

• What are the key demographic attributes of diabetes patients?
• How do fasting blood glucose levels vary across different age groups?
• What is the correlation between BMI and blood glucose levels?
• What are the trends in HbA1c levels over time?
• How does the diabetes pedigree function relate to other health metrics?
• What are the patterns in blood pressure and insulin levels among patients?



## Analysis
The analysis was conducted using Python and its libraries: NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn.


## Steps:

### Data Import:
Imported the raw data from CSV files using Pandas.

### Data Cleaning:
Ensured data accuracy and consistency by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and correcting errors.

### Data Transformation:
Transformed the data to make it suitable for analysis. This included calculations, aggregations, and filtering operations. Created new columns required for the analysis using Pandas.

### Data Visualization:
Utilized Seaborn to create interactive visualizations, representing the analyzed data through charts, graphs, and other visual elements.



## Insights

## Patient Demographics:

• Age Distribution: Majority of patients fall within the 50-60 age range.
• Gender Balance: Gender distribution is approximately balanced with a slight female predominance.
• Demographic Patterns: Analysis of demographic patterns indicates potential age and gender-specific risk factors.

## Blood Glucose Levels:

• Fasting Blood Glucose: Variations in fasting blood glucose levels across different age groups were identified.
• HbA1c Trends: Trends in HbA1c levels indicate long-term blood glucose control challenges.

## BMI and Health Metrics:

• BMI Correlation: Positive correlation between BMI and blood glucose levels, indicating higher diabetes risk with increasing BMI.
• Health Risk Factors: Identified key health risk factors associated with high BMI.

## Correlation Analysis:

• Metric Correlations: Significant correlations between fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, BMI, and other health metrics were identified.
• Diabetes Pedigree Function: Relationship between diabetes pedigree function and other health metrics provides insights into genetic predispositions.

## Trend Analysis:

• Temporal Trends: Trends in HbA1c and blood glucose levels over time reveal patterns in diabetes management and control.
• Seasonal Variations: Identified potential seasonal variations in health metrics.



# Conclusion
